       Hello! My name is Brian, and I'm currently living on Long Island in New York.<br/><br/>
      
       I work for <a href="http://www.freecause.com/">FreeCause</a> as a system administrator / deployment engineer.  I consider myself a jack of all trades when it comes to the world of computers.  I have worked on projects as a software engineer, run both academic and corporate networks, and last but not least I have played IT guy for friends, family and businesses for the past 15 years or so.<br/><br/>
       
       This website primarily serves as my academic and professional work portfolio. It contains information on a few of my projects, resume, and contact information.<br/><br/>
       
       Lately I've been working on creating a jQuery based online game, it is currently a work in progress and can be found on my projects page.  I have also started <a href="http://www.twitter.com/brianwbianco">tweeting</a> about updates to it.<br/><br/>

			<div class="project-shooter generic project-content">
			After discovering how great jQuery was, I decided I wanted to see what kind of a game I could make using it.  I hadn't found any jQuery based shooters 	that didn't suffer from all sorts of different problems.  I set out to make my own, and <a href="Shooter Game/index.html">these</a> are the results.<br/>

			<div class="project-quadtree generic project-content">
			While creating my shooting game it quickly became apparent that there was way too much slow down occurring during the bullet collision detection.  That meant it was time to create some type of data structure to reduce the amount of comparisons that would occur.  Click right <a href="Shooter Game/quadtree.html">here</a> to see it<br/>

    		I went about trying to find a nice light box plugin for the images I was posting on my sight but was a bit turned off by how many requirements most of them had.  I didn't want anything that involved adding plugins beyond the light box itself, extra images and all sorts of other junk.  I decided this was a good time to not only create what I wanted but educate myself on jQuery plugins.  Here is the <a href="js/jquery.clickShow.js">result</a> (which is of course used on my site)

    	We were tasked with creating a robot that could navigate streets and read signs as a project in our real time systems class.  I was the team lead in a group of 6 students.  I spent most of my personal time writing the brains of the robot itself in C and ASM.  All of the image data pulled from the camera was sent off to a server (written in Java) for image processing.  The car itself was autonomous but could defer control to the server for specific directions.
