			jQuery based Shooter<br/>
			<div class="project-shooter generic project-content">
			After discovering how great jQuery was, I decided I wanted to see what kind of a game I could make using it.  I hadn't found any jQuery based shooters 	that didn't suffer from all sorts of different problems.  I set out to make my own, and <a href="/shooter">these</a> are the results.<br/>

		<div>
			javascript quad tree implementation<br/>
			<div class="project-quadtree generic project-content">
			While creating my shooting game it quickly became apparent that there was way too much slow down occurring during the bullet collision detection.  That meant it was time to create some type of data structure to reduce the amount of comparisons that would occur.  Click right <a href="shooter/quadtree.html">here</a> to see it<br/>

    		Information about this page!<br/>
			<div class="project-website generic project-content">
			I created this site both as a professional resume, and portfolio for my projects.  I've noticed that over time i've lost many projects due to not having a central place to store them.  I've created everything here using javascript and jQuery on my macbook pro.

    		<div class="project-showclick generic project-content">
    		I went about trying to find a nice light box plugin for the images I was posting on my sight but was a bit turned off by how many requirements most of them had.  I didn't want anything that involved adding plugins beyond the light box itself, extra images and all sorts of other junk.  I decided this was a good time to not only create what I wanted but educate myself on jQuery plugins.  Here is the <a href="js/jquery.clickShow.js">result</a> (which is of course used on my site)
